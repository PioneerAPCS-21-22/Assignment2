# Assignment 2

A convenient algorithm for determining the date of Easter in a given year was devised in 1876 and first appeared in Butcherâ€™s Ecclesiastical Handbook. This algorithm holds for any year in the Gregorian calendar, which means years including and after 1583. Subject to minor adaptations, the algorithm is as follows:

1. Let y be the year (such as 1583 or 2003).
2. Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.
3. Divide y by 100 and get a quotient b and a remainder c.
4. Divide b by 4 and get a quotient d and a remainder e.
5. Divide b + 8 by 25 and get a quotient f. Ignore the remainder.
6. Divide b - f + 1 by 3 and get a quotient g. Ignore the remainder.
7. Divide 19 \* a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 and get a remainder h. Ignore the quotient.
8. Divide c by 4 and get a quotient i and a remainder k.
9. Divide 32 + 2 \* e + 2 \* i - h - k by 7 and get a remainder r. Ignore the quotient.
10. Divide a + 11 \* h + 22 \* r by 451 and get a quotient m. Ignore the remainder.
11. Divide h + r - 7 \* m + 114 by 31 and get a quotient n and a remainder p.

The month is `n` and the day is `p+1`.

## Specifications

* Write a program to solve for the day that Easter falls on for a given year.
* Your program should take input from the user for the desired year and set that equal to a variable.
* Display the values for all of the variables, and output the date for Easter.

### Sample Outputs

Here is a sample output for 2022.

```
What year? 2022

a: 6
b: 20
c: 20
d: 5
e: 0
f: 1
g: 6
h: 18
i: 5
k: 0
r: 3
m: 0
n: 4
p: 16

Easter is on 4/17 in 2022.
```

Verify that the program gives the correct date of Easter for the current year.

### Comments and Style

* Update the comments at the top of the file with your name and the date.
* Remember to use consistent styling (brace placement, spaces, returns, etc.).
